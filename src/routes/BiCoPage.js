            <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2rem" }}>
              I conducted interviews with various members of the Bryn Mawr and
              Haverford community to better understand the current state of
              affairs within the BiCo. I wanted to better understand where the
              community currently stands so that we can better explore what we
              need to do to move forward: into a future where hopefully more
              restorative justice practices and principles will be included
              within processes. I would argue that the most concrete
              manifestation of BiCo values is the{" "}

                Honor Code
              </a>
              , where these values seem to be codified. Thus, I asked questions
              specifically about my interviewees understanding and experiences
              with the Honor Code. As I was less concerned with academic
              violations than the social (since those should be addressed with
              traditional punitive measures), I chose to focus most of my
              questions on the Social Honor Code (see Appendix 1 for interview
              questions). The Social Honor Code acts largely as a Social
              Contract (both explicit and implicit), which guides the ways in
              which members of the community interact with one another.

              This interviewee generally viewed the (social) honor code as
              providing guidance they thought of as being common sense. For
              them, the honor code was more so affirming their existing beliefs
              than imposing new ones upon them. They said that it creates an
              "underlying pressure of being nice and then being kind to each
              other." Before coming to BMC, this person believed that basic
              respect was enough to guide social interactions. After, they
              learned about the racism in America and saw how basic respect was
              not enough. Though this knowledge has not influenced <i>who</i>{" "}
              they make friends with, it has shaped how they interact with those
              people. More specifically, it has made them more careful in how
              they approach certain topics and even whether they bring up those
              topics at all.

              For this person, the honor code is mainly academic. They were not
              explicitly aware of the social component of the honor code before
              the interview, they seemed to be aware of certain aspects of the
              code: the part that encourages students to confront the people who
              have violated the honor code and the other people they may have
              other conflicts with. They describe how "people at the school
              including [them]...are very afraid of confrontation, because you
              don't want to burn bridges, especially when you're going to see
              some person over and over again and they'll just be awkward. If
              you confront them and make them feel like they're they're in a
              position where they have to be defensive...and it will affect our
              relationship." I found this comment insightful as it clearly shows
              why students are generally wary of confronting their peers,
              despite the practice being endorsed by the honor code.

              Though this interviewee remembers going over the honor code when
              they were applying and in THRIVE, they do not really remember much
              of it now. Thinking about what they think the honor code should
              be, they said that they wanted it to be about being "a decent
              human being considering your classmates feelings and creating a
              safe place for all students on campus."
