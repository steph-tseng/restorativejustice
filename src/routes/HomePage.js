            Restorative justice (RJ) reconceptualizes the way justice is carried
            out. Rather than thinking about justice as punishment to be doled
            out by a neutral third party, it thinks about justice as fulfilling
            the needs of the victim. Furthermore, it does not think about
            justice as determining guilt or who is good/bad. The criminal
            justice system focuses on the needs of the state to maintain law and
            order. Meanwhile, RJ focuses on the relationship between the victim
            and perpetrator, as well as their ties to the greater community. The
            two parties are given an opportunity to communicate, whether
            directly or indirectly, so that the victim is able to receive
            answers to any questions they may have surrounding the crime. In
            this communication, the perpetrator is also confronted with the harm
            that they have caused and must take responsibility for that harm.
            The focus, too, is on how to rebuild the relationship between the
            two involved parties and their community so that neither feels
            neglected or alienated.
