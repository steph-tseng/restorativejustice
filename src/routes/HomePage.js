          Restorative justice (RJ) reconceptualizes the way justice is carried
          out. Rather than thinking about justice as punishment to be doled out
          by a neutral third party, it thinks about justice as fulfilling the
          needs of the victim. Furthermore, it does not think about justice as
          determining guilt or who is good/bad. The criminal justice system
          focuses on the needs of the state to maintain law and order.
          Meanwhile, RJ focuses on the relationship between the victim and
          perpetrator, as well as their ties to the greater community. The two
          parties are given an opportunity to communicate, whether directly or
          indirectly, so that the victim is able to receive answers to any
          questions they may have surrounding the crime. In this communication,
          the perpetrator is also confronted with the harm that they have caused
          and must take responsibility for that harm. The focus, too, is on how
          to rebuild the relationship between the two involved parties and their
          community so that neither feels neglected or alienated.
